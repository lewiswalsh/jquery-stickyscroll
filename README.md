jquery-stickyscroll
===================

Tiny jQuery plugin (~0.3kb minified) to pin an element to the top of the screen when the user scrolls past it.

####Requirements
This approach requires that the element have a width set. For all the usecases I have come across so far this has been easy to accommodate. Future versions may negate this need.

####Options
At the moment there is only one option, `verticalPadding`, this is the distance in pixels from the top of the screen that the sticky element will stay.
